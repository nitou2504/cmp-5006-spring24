Hiding relevant information from national authorities or altering military data incurs punishment. During armed conflict, penalties increase to ten to thirteen years' imprisonment. Its scope is to deter espionage activities threatening national security and sovereignty, safeguarding classified information and military operations' integrity.


**Article 470** prohibits recording personal communications without prior knowledge and authorization from the involved parties, except as permitted by law. Illegally obtained information holds no legal validity. Risks, damages, and losses resulting from forced information disclosure are attributable to the initiator, who must provide full reparations. Its scope is to protect individuals' privacy rights, ensuring legal compliance and accountability for unauthorized recording or disclosure of personal communications, safeguarding against privacy violations and ensuring appropriate restitution for damages.

**Article 475** governs the retention, opening, and examination of correspondence and documents,electronic or physical, declaring them inviolable except when authorized by the Constitution or this Code. It allows judges to authorize prosecutors to retain, open, and examine correspondence with sufficient evidence for investigation. Prior notification is required for opening correspondence related to an offense, with confidentiality ensured and witnesses present if necessary. Documents are added to the case if relevant, otherwise returned. Decryption or translation is mandated for coded or foreign-language documents.

**Article 476** regulates the interception of communications or computer data, requiring a reasoned request from the prosecutor to the judge, based on relevant indications for the investigation's purposes. The judge determines the intercepted communication and the duration, up to ninety days, extendable once for ninety days or up to six months for organized crime cases. Information obtained is used solely for authorized processes, with an obligation of secrecy. Any discovered offenses prompt immediate investigation. Intercepting data transmission through telecommunications services requires judicial authorization, respecting professional and religious secrecy. Only pertinent conversations are transcribed, and irrelevant data are deleted, supervised by the judge. Telecom service providers and intercepting personnel must maintain confidentiality except in court. Information storage must comply with legal requirements. Intercepting communications violating children's rights or exacerbating violence is prohibited.

**Article 477.1** governs data preservation, allowing the prosecutor to order natural or legal persons to preserve specific computer data without judicial authorization if there are grounds to suspect vulnerability to loss or modification. This preservation lasts up to ninety days, extendable equally if grounds persist. The National Police can request preservation in flagrant crimes, with notification to the prosecutor within eight hours. Recipients must preserve data immediately, maintaining confidentiality under penalty of criminal liability. Communication service providers must inform issuing authorities if communication involves other providers, facilitating data conservation.

**Article 477.2** grants prosecutors and judges the authority to order any individual or entity within national jurisdiction to present or deliver data stored in a computer system or storage device related to a specific crime investigation. The order may include confidentiality instructions under penalty of criminal sanction. Prosecutors, without judicial authorization, can similarly issue orders for subscriber and traffic data. These measures aim to facilitate data retrieval crucial to criminal investigations while ensuring confidentiality and legal compliance.

**Article 477.3** empowers judges, upon the prosecutor's request, to authorize the search, seizure, and access of computer systems or their data storage devices. They can order the seizure of physical system components and devices for data reading, obtain full data copies, and take actions to render data inaccessible or delete them. The judge's order may extend to other systems containing sought-after data or accessible from the initial system. General rules and limitations for document seizure apply.

**Article 477.4** mandates national authorities to cooperate with foreign counterparts in investigations or proceedings concerning information and communication technology-related crimes or obtaining digital evidence. It allows Ecuadorian authorities to request such information from foreign authorities in accordance with international agreements and domestic law. This provision facilitates cross-border collaboration in combating cybercrimes and ensuring effective handling of digital evidence, aligning with international legal frameworks and Ecuador's obligations.


**Article 477.5** outlines rules for the expedited preservation and disclosure of digital content in international cooperation. It mandates national authorities to preserve and disclose digital content promptly upon request from foreign authorities, following international agreements and domestic law. Requests for preservation of digital content stored in Ecuador will be made through expedited communication channels. Disclosure of such content requires a request for international legal assistance. The competent authority will issue preservation orders to those in control or possession of the digital content, specifying the nature and duration of preservation, extendable up to ninety days. Preserved digital content will only be disclosed to the prosecuting authority or the national authority that issued the preservation order. These rules apply reciprocally to requests made by Ecuadorian authorities acting as petitioners.


**Article 477.6** delineates reasons for denial of expedited preservation or disclosure of digital content. Denials occur when the digital content relates to a political or related offense under Ecuadorian law, or when it jeopardizes Ecuador's sovereignty, security, public order, or other interests. Denial may also stem from reasonable belief that the request execution will be rejected due to lack of proof of the non bis in idem principle.

**Article 477.7** allows national judicial authorities, upon request from a foreign competent authority, to conduct searches, seizures, accesses, or seizures of digital content stored in Ecuador. This applies when similar actions would be permissible in a domestic case. Prompt action is mandated when digital content is deemed vulnerable to loss or modification, or when expedited cooperation is stipulated in an applicable international instrument. These provisions apply reciprocally to requests made by Ecuadorian authorities acting as petitioners.

**Article 477.8** allows foreign competent authorities, without prior request to Ecuadorian authorities, to access digital content stored in Ecuador under two conditions: firstly, when the content is publicly available, and secondly, when access is granted through a computer system located in their territory, with the legal and voluntary consent of the person authorized to disclose it.

**Article 477.9** mandates Ecuador to maintain a permanent contact point for international cooperation, available 24/7. This contact point facilitates technical advice, expedited preservation of digital content in emergencies, evidence collection, suspect location, and immediate transmission of requests to the competent judicial authority for prompt execution, aligning with international agreements and protocols.

**Article 477.10** allows for the interception of data transmissions through a computer system located in Ecuador, upon request from a competent foreign authority. This is permissible if provided for in an international agreement and if interception is allowed in a similar domestic case. The procedure and limits outlined in Article 476 of the Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code must be respected and observed.

## 3.	What kind of crimes or infractions can a person be judged for using those articles?


1. **Interception of Data**: Articles such as 230 and 477.10 address the illegal interception of data without proper authorization, which could include accessing, listening to, diverting, recording, or observing data without consent, potentially leading to charges of unauthorized access to computer systems or interception of communications.

2. **Unauthorized Access and Modification**: Articles like 192 and 234 cover crimes related to unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or electronic devices, as well as unauthorized modification of data, which could lead to charges of hacking, computer fraud, or unauthorized use of computer resources.

## 4.	What kind of evidence could the persecutors use to incriminate someone with this kind of crime?

 
Persecutors can employ various legal mechanisms outlined in the Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code to gather evidence and incriminate individuals suspected of cybercrimes. 

Firstly, **Article 476.4** authorizes the interception and recording of computer data transmissions across a wide range of telecommunications services, ncluding fixed, satellite, mobile, and wireless telephony, as well as services like voice calls, SMS, MMS, data transmission, VoIP, email, social networks, video conferencing, multimedia, among others.This allows prosecutors to monitor digital communications to verify the existence of an offense or identify responsible parties.

Secondly, **Article 477.1** empowers prosecutors to order the preservation of specific computer data without judicial authorization, particularly when there are grounds to suspect the data's vulnerability to loss or modification. This preservation mandate extends to subscriber and traffic data, ensuring the integrity of potential evidence for up to ninety days.

Thirdly, **Article 477.3** grants judges, at the prosecutor's request, the authority to conduct searches, seizures, and accesses of computer systems or data storage devices. Judges can authorize the seizure of physical system components, obtain full data copies, and take actions to render data inaccessible or delete them, facilitating the collection of digital evidence crucial to cybercrime investigations.

Moreover, **Article 477.4** establishes cooperation between national and foreign competent authorities in investigating technology-related crimes and obtaining digital evidence. This cooperation enables prosecutors to request information from foreign authorities in accordance with international agreements and domestic law, enhancing the scope and effectiveness of cybercrime investigations.

Lastly, **Article 477.10** allows for the interception of data transmissions through computer systems located in Ecuador upon request from competent foreign authorities, provided it aligns with international agreements and respects domestic legal procedures. This enables prosecutors to collaborate with foreign counterparts to gather evidence and pursue cybercrime cases across borders.


## 5.	Provide a summary of the Ola Bini's case, and present the main arguments and crimes he was accused of.

Ola Bini, a Swedish computer scientist, found himself embroiled in a lengthy legal battle in Ecuador, accused of "attempted unauthorized access to a public computer system." The case dates back to April 2019 when Bini was arrested in Quito while attempting to leave for Japan. His arrest came shortly after Ecuador revoked Julian Assange's asylum at its embassy in London, leading to Assange's subsequent arrest in the UK.

The prosecution alleged that Bini, using his specialized technical knowledge, attempted to access the systems of the state-owned National Telecommunications Corporation (CNT) without authorization. It was claimed that he sought to obtain information from the digital platforms of Petroecuador and the former National Intelligence Secretariat. However, Bini's defense staunchly denied these charges, pointing out various irregularities in the legal process.

The case against Bini was based on the Article 234 of the Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code, which penalizes unauthorized access to computer, telematic, or telecommunications systems. The main proof presented by the prosecution was a grainy image of a telnet session, which they claimed showed Bini attempting to access the CNT's systems. 

The image is the following: ![shot](images/ola-bini-command-line-1.png)

With this image—which the lower court had already ruled as not evidence of criminal activity—and the testimony of an expert to the lower court—who never had access to the devices and systems involved in the alleged intrusion—the prosecutor argued that by connecting to a router, Bini performed a partially unauthorized access in an attempt to breach a system provided by the Ecuadorian national telecommunications company (CNT) to a presidency contingency center.

Luis Enríquez from the Cyber Rights Observatory and Technosociety says that what is visible on the screen is evidence that no system entry occurred. "What we see on the screen is Ola Bini's terminal, and precisely a timeout, meaning the connection was unsuccessful (...) it's like passing by a street, seeing the post office building, staying at the window, and leaving."

The court emphasized the need for solid evidence to prove an alleged cybercrime and deemed the telnet session image presented in Bini's case insufficient for this purpose. The court clarified that images susceptible to alteration do not constitute evidence of cybercrime, as they cannot verify whether the commands illustrated in them were actually executed. 

Key arguments in Bini's defense included the lack of solid evidence to support the allegations of cybercrime. The court ruled that a grainy image of a telnet session, presented by the prosecution, was insufficient to prove unauthorized access. Furthermore, expert testimonies emphasized the need for verifiable digital evidence, which was lacking in the case. In January 2022, a Criminal Guarantees Tribunal of the Pichincha Provincial Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against Bini, but the Prosecutor's Office appealed the ruling

The prosecutors appealed the verdict and returned to court using the same image, which failed to demonstrate any criminal activity. In the hearing on March 26th, the Prosecutor's Office claimed that their expert's analysis of the telnet image demonstrated connectivity with the router. The witness likened it to entering someone's property's yard to see if the property's gate is open or closed. Entering the yard is analogous to connecting to the router, the witness said.

However, no examination was conducted on the supposedly affected systems. The expert's testimony was based on his analysis of a report from CNT: he did not have access to CNT's router to verify its configuration. He did not digitally validate whether the events described in the report actually occurred, and he was never asked to verify the existence of an IP address owned or managed by CNT.

The Provincial Court of Pichincha has determined on April 5th that Ola Bini is guilty of the crime of attempted unauthorized access to a public computer system. The court sentenced him to one year in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of 4 basic salaries. 

## 6.	What is your opinion of the case in general and its outcome?

With the case context, we believe that the proof presented by the prosecution was insufficient to establish his guilt. The reliance on a single grainy image of a telnet session, which did not demonstrate any criminal activity, was a weak foundation for the charges of attempted unauthorized access to a public computer system. And the lack of a deeper investigation into the systems involved, makes us, as information security students, question if the Ecuadorian justice system is fair and reliable when it comes to cybercrimes.

The outcome for Ola Bini is concerning, as the court's decision to find him guilty based on insufficient evidence raises questions on how we as civilians can be protected from unjust accusations and irregular legal processes. Furthermore, it seems that the political context surrounding Bini's case, had more weight than the actual evidence presented in the trial.

In conclusion, the case of Ola Bini highlights the absence of digital forensic expertise on the part of the prosecution, the lack of verifiable evidence to support the charges, and the potential for political influence to impact legal proceedings. The outcome of the case is just a reflection of how poorly the Ecuadorian justice system is.

## 7. How do the terms of services of applications like Whatsapp and TikTok align with the privacy laws in Ecuador? What kind of protections Ecuadorian citizens are guaranteed under the law?

Under Ecuadorian law, citizens are guaranteed certain protections regarding their personal data and digital privacy. Some of the key provisions that may apply include:

1. **Article 178**: This article addresses privacy violation and penalizes unauthorized access, interception, recording, or dissemination of personal data. It ensures that individuals have control over their personal information and prohibits its unauthorized use.

2. **Article 229**: Prohibits the revealing of data from electronic systems without authorization, aiming to protect privacy and confidentiality in digital communication.

3. **Article 230**: Addresses illegal data interception and penalizes unauthorized access to electronic data. This provision aims to protect digital privacy and ensure the integrity of electronic transactions.

4. **Article 231**: Penalizes electronic transfer of assets without consent, protecting individuals' assets from fraudulent manipulation of digital systems.

5. **Article 470**: Prohibits recording personal communications without authorization, ensuring individuals' privacy rights are protected.

6. **Article 475**: Governs the retention, opening, and examination of correspondence and documents, electronic or physical, declaring them inviolable except when authorized by law. This ensures that individuals' communications are protected from unauthorized access.

7. **Article 476**: Regulates the interception of communications or computer data, requiring judicial authorization based on relevant indications for investigation purposes. This ensures that interceptions are conducted lawfully and with proper oversight.

8. **Article 477**: Provides provisions for data preservation, disclosure, and international cooperation in criminal investigations involving digital content. This ensures that data is handled appropriately and in accordance with legal procedures.

Meta companies and TikTok, like other digital platforms, outline their data handling practices without enough lever of detail. And even though, there are expections per country under their terms of service, Ecuador does not have a specific mention there. 


However, some of the relevant articles mentioned before show many ways in which these companies can be liable for misuse or at least be in obligation to facilitate the execution of justice. For example, even though articles **178, 229 and 230** may refer to individuals who access private information of others, it may be applied to companies that do not make clear enough what data is being collected from users, or collect data without aproval of users (mainly because of ignorance). 

Furthermore, if for example their information is leaked and some malicious party was to access and misuse the list of contacts from high profiles in their country as well as their hardware identifying information (according to article **192**) a case could be held against that platform.

Also, other articles like **475, 476 and 477** show that the Ecuadorian justice can request information from these companies for individuals under juridical investigations.
